# Github-Profile-Finder

A github profile finder application made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Github API. Users can find any github user by searching with the exact github username. Users can also see github user's details and latest repositories.

I learnt and practised it from [Brad Traversy from Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia)
